For that purpose,\nwe will develop a predictive model and create the plots to discuss the results\nwith our marketing colleagues. Since we want to show you how to build the plots,\nnot how to build a perfect model, we'll use six of these columns in our example.\n\nHere's a short description on the data we use:\n\n- ``y``: has the client subscribed a term deposit?\n- ``duration``: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric)\n- ``campaign``: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client\n- ``pdays``: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign\n- ``previous``: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)\n- ``euribor3m``: euribor 3 month rate\n\nLet's load the data and have a quick look at it:\n"
