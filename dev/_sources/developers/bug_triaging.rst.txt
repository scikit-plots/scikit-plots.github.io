Bug triaging and issue curation
===============================

The `issue tracker <https://github.com/scikit-plots/scikit-plots/issues>`_
is important to the communication in the project: it helps
developers identify major projects to work on, as well as to discuss
priorities. For this reason, it is important to curate it, adding labels
to issues and closing issues that are not necessary.
