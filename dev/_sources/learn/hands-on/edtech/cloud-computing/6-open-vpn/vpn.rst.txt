VPN Overview
------------
VPN is short for a *Virtual Private Network*. Just like with other virtualized
services, a virtual network replicates a physical network using software. VPNs
allow users to create a virtual network using physical nodes that exist on
another network regardless of geographical location.

VPNs are popular with corporations to connect offices together that are in
different locations. Also, workers who traveled could connect to their
corporate networks using a VPN. Nowadays, VPNs are popular with the average
internet user who wants privacy online or they use a VPN to bypass restrictions
on content.

**There are two primary types of VPN connections.**

  1. Remote Access VPN - used to access a remote network or to virtually place
     a user in a different location on the internet

     a. Commercial VPNs use this method to place a customer on their network.
     b. A remote worker uses this type to connect to their office network.
  #. Site-to-site VPN - connects LANs in different locations

     a. Companies use this type to create larger corporate networks.

**There are different types of VPN protocols. Here are five that are
used commonly.**

  #. OpenVPN
  #. L2TP/IPsec – Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol
  #. SSTP – Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol
  #. IKEv2 - IKEv2/IPsec – Internet Key Exchange
  #. PPTP – Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol
