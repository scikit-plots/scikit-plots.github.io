6: Creating a Process in C
==========================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

This lab shows how to create a process in Windows using the system call
``CreateProcess()``. More information on Microsoft’s site:

-  |Creating Processes|
-  |CreateProcessA function|

Please create a file called ``lab6.c`` from the
:ref:`template C file <basic-c-template>` for this assignment.

6.1. Creating a Process
-----------------------
Creating a process in Windows is a multi-step process:

#. Create the variables
#. Allocate memory
#. Call ``CreateProcess()``
#. Release the process handles

``CreateProcess()`` requires several important parameters.

  #. The full path to the application or program to execute.
  #. Pointer to ``STARTUPINFO`` struct.

   .. note:: You must allocate the memory required for the struct.

#. Pointer to |PROCESS_INFORMATION| struct.

Here is the |full parameter list| for ``CreateProcess()``.

.. _CreateProcess template code:

``CreateProcess()`` Template Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Required Include Files**

    .. code-block:: c

        #include <windows.h>

**Example Usages**

    .. code-block:: c

        char exe_path[] = "C:\\Windows\\system32\\notepad.exe";
        STARTUPINFO startup_info;
        PROCESS_INFORMATION process_info;

        BOOL process_status = FALSE;

        // allocate memory and clear memory
        ZeroMemory(&startup_info, sizeof(startup_info));
        startup_info.cb = sizeof(startup_info);
        ZeroMemory(&process_info, sizeof(process_info));

        process_status = CreateProcess(
            NULL,           // Use the command line arg instead
            exe_path,       // path to exe using command line
            NULL,           // Process handle not inheritable
            NULL,           // Thread handle not inheritable
            FALSE,          // Set handle inheritance to FALSE
            0,              // No creation flags
            NULL,           // Use parent's environment block
            NULL,           // Use parent's starting directory
            &startup_info,  // Pointer to STARTUPINFO structure
            &process_info); // Pointer to PROCESS_INFORMATION structure

        /* Do work with handles */

        // Close process handles and clean up
        CloseHandle(process_info.hProcess);
        CloseHandle(process_info.hThread);

6.1.1. Task
~~~~~~~~~~~
Your first task is to create a process and verify the process status.

#. Create a new process for notepad.exe.
#. Verify if that process created successfully by evaluating the return
   ``bool`` flag.
#. Close the process handles.
#. Print an error message with the file path and exit the program with
   ``return 1`` if the process did not start.

**Expected Output**

::

    // Failure
    Error. Failed to execute C:\\Windows\\system64\\invalid\_file.exe.

    // Success
    A new Notepad opened.

6.2. Process Information
------------------------

|PROCESS_INFORMATION| struct contains these fields:

.. code-block:: c

    typedef struct _PROCESS_INFORMATION {
      HANDLE hProcess;
      HANDLE hThread;
      DWORD  dwProcessId;
      DWORD  dwThreadId;
    } PROCESS_INFORMATION, *PPROCESS_INFORMATION, *LPPROCESS_INFORMATION;

6.2.1. Task
~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Print the process ID of the process

**Expected Output**

::

    Created a new process with ID 14156.

6.3. Waiting for the Process to Exit
------------------------------------

At this point, your program created a new child process and then exited
immediately. We can observe the behavior by using the sleep function to
watch the process change parents from your program to root.

6.3.1. Task
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Download and then start |Process Explorer|.
#. Use the sleep function to pause your program for 15-20 seconds.

   * ``Sleep(15000);``
#. Find your application in the Process Explorer list. Click on the child
   process to highlight it.|br|
   |image1|
#. Watch what happens when your application exits.|br|
   |image2| |br|
   |image3|

Instead of exiting or processing additional code, the parent program can
use ``WaitForSingleObject()`` to wait on the child to complete its work
and then terminate.

    .. code-block:: c

        // The second field is milliseconds for a set time or INFINITE
        WaitForSingleObject( process_info.hProcess, INFINITE );

5. Add function ``WaitForSingleObject()``.
#. Your program should stay active until you close the Notepad window.
