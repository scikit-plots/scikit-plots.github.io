Overview
==========
You will write a program to convert the contents of a byte stored in an
array between |Big Endian and Little Endian|. |Endianness| defines the
order of byte. You will work with a simulation of a byte.

Big Endian Byte Order
---------------------

  Big endian byte order is **most significant** byte (the "big end") of
  the data is placed at the byte with the lowest address. The rest of
  the data is placed in order in the next three bytes in memory.

  For example, little-endian byte order stores a hex value of 0x12345678
  in memory as:

  .. csv-table:: Big Endian Byte Order 0x12345678
      :header: "0x100","0x101","0x102","0x103"

      12,34,56,78

Little Endian Byte Order
--------------------------

  Little endian byte order is the **least significant** byte
  (the "little end") of the data is placed at the byte with the lowest
  address. The rest of the data is placed in order in the next three
  bytes in memory.

  For example, little-endian byte order stores a hex value of 0x12345678
  in memory as:

  .. csv-table:: Little Endian Byte Order 0x12345678
      :header: "0x100","0x101","0x102","0x103"

Arrays in C
--------------
An array in C is always passed by reference. You need three pieces of
data when working with an array:

  #. The pointer to the array
  #. The type of data
  #. The length of the array

Here are some ways to create an array:

.. code-block:: C

    // Allocate memory, but don't initialize
    int array[10];

    // Initialize with zeros
    int array[10] = {0}

    // Create and populate with data
    int array[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};

    // Get the pointer to an array
    int *p = array;

Task 1: Create an Array
==========================================
Your first task is to create an array of the power table using
**big-endian ordering** that represents a byte that is ordered
from most significant to least significant.

  .. csv-table:: Big Endian Byte Order for the power table
      :header: "2 :sup:`7`","2 :sup:`6`","2 :sup:`5`","2 :sup:`4`","2 :sup:`3`","2 :sup:`2`","2 :sup:`1`","2 :sup:`0`"

      128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1

#. Open up |ide.judge0.com| or use VSC and GCC using a
   template from :ref:`c-templates`.
#. Create an ``int`` array of the power table. Start with
   2 :sup:`0` to 2 :sup:`7`.

   - Your program should work with an array of size 'n'.

   .. hint::
       - Use a ``define`` statement to set the array size at compile time.

         .. code-block:: C

             #define SIZE 8

       - You can change it later to 16 to process an array from
         2 :sup:`0` to 2 :sup:`15`.

#. Print the contents to the screen

.. code-block:: text
    :caption: Expected Output

    Big Endian Order:     128 63 32 16 8 4 2 1

Task 2: Reverse the Array
==========================================
Your second task is to reverse the array to show the the power table in
**little-endian ordering** that represents a byte in order from least
significant to most significant.

  .. csv-table:: Little Endian Byte Order for the power table
      :header: "2 :sup:`0`","2 :sup:`1`","2 :sup:`2`","2 :sup:`3`","2 :sup:`4`","2 :sup:`5`","2 :sup:`6`","2 :sup:`7`"

      1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128

.. note::
    Do not create a function for this yet. You will do that in a later step.

#. Reverse the array.
#. Print the array showing big-endian ordering.

.. code-block:: text
    :caption: Expected Output

    Big Endian Order:     128 63 32 16 8 4 2 1
    Little Endian Order:  1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128

Task 3: Create Functions
==========================================
We don't like doing a lot of work in function ``main()``. Instead, we should
create some functions to do the work.

C does not contain an array length property like higher-level languages.
You must calculate the size based on the memory allocation. See the
answer to the question |How do I determine the size of my array in C?| in
Stack Overflow.

For this activity, you will use the value in the ``#define`` instead
of trying to determine the array size.

#. Create a function using this prototype that prints the contents
   of an array.

   .. code-block:: C

       /*
        * int array:  the pointer to the array
        */
       void print_array(int *);

#. Create a function using this prototype that creates and returns an array.
   Here is an example of how to |return an array from a function in C|.

   .. code-block:: C

       /*
        * return value:   the pointer to the array
        */
       int *create_array();

#. Create a function using this prototype that reverses the array

   .. code-block:: C

       /*
        * int array:        the pointer to the big-endian array
        * return value:     the pointer to the little-endian array
        */
       int *convert_to_little_endian(int *);

Task 4: User Selected Order
===============================
Use the command line args to give the user an option to view
the array in the little-endian or big-endian byte order.

#. Add the command line args code from :ref:`c-templates`.
#. Print this message if there are no args:

   .. code-block:: text

       Usage: endianness [value]
           b    Big Endian Byte Order
           l    Little Endian Byte Order

#. Convert the arg to a ``char`` instead of doing a string comparison.
   ``chars`` are ``integers``, which makes it easy to work with.
   See an example of how to |convert a command line arg to a char|.

   - ``*argv[]`` in ``main()`` is a 2D array (an array of strings).
   - ``argv[1]`` is a char array or a string terminated with the ``\0``
     (the null terminator).
   - For example, executing ``endianness.exe l`` will contain an array
     with two ``chars``: ``{ 'l' , '\0' }``
   - You can get the ``'l'`` char by accessing the first element of the
     arg.

       .. code-block:: C

           // argv[1]    --> { 'l' , '\0' }
           // argv[1][0] --> 'l'
           char order = argv[1][0];

#. Display the array in big or little-endian order based on the user
   selection.
