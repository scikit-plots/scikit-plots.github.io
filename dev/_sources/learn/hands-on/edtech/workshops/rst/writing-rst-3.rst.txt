RST Colored Boxes
==================

`Colored boxes <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/demo/demo.html#admonitions>`_
provide a way to emphasize blocks of text using blue, green, orange/yellow,
or red using the directive ``.. box-type::``.

They all use the same syntax using a different keyword:

.. list-table:: Colored Box Types
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 15 65

   * - Type/Keyword
     - Color/Note
     - Example
   * - danger, error
     - red
     - ``.. danger:: Watch out!``
   * - attention, caution, warning
     - orange
     - ``.. Caution:: Subroutine is not cross-platform.``
   * - hint, important, tip
     - blue
     - ``.. Note:: A generic blue box``
   * - admonition
     - blue
     -
       .. code-block:: rst

           .. admonition:: Custom label

               The contents of the blue box.

.. tip::

    * Colored boxes act as text blocks because anything indented
      four spaces stay in the text box.
    * For example, this list!

.. note:: RST lines should be 80 characters long

.. admonition:: As a final thought

    You don't have to use the *note* title for a blue box. Instead, use
    your own text!

.. code-block:: rst
    :caption: RST for the above boxes

    .. tip::

        * Colored boxes act as paragraphs because anything indented
          four spaces stay in the text box.
        * For example, this list!

    .. note:: RST lines should be 80 characters long

    .. admonition:: As a final thought

        You don't have to use *note* for a blue box. Instead, use
        your own title!

Task
=============

**Task 3**: Add text to *Installing Sphinx*  to learn how to use a
``note`` box.

* Use inline styles and hyperlinks appropriately.
* Add a ``note`` about using other distributions

  .. note:: A default note has this style.
      There are other default boxes,
      such as `hint and warning <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/demo/demo.html#admonitions>`_.

Text to add
=============

    .. code-block:: text

        The Sphinx documentation <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html>
        provides instructions for Debian/Ubuntu (apt), RHEL/CentOS (yum),
        and MacOS (homebrew). This guide will uses the ``apt`` package manager.

        Unfortunately, the apt package manager for Debian has an old version of
        Sphinx (Sphinx 1.8.4). It works, but PyPI has the latest version of
        Sphinx <https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/>. Therefore, this guide
        shows to install Sphinx using both ``apt`` and ``pip3``.

        Note: Other distributions are supported using pip, such as Alpine Linux.
        However, additional knowledge is required to install prerequisites for
        specific Python packages.
