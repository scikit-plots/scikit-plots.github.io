RST Workshop: Setting up a Sphinx Server
########################################

.. note:: This guide serves two purposes:

    #. It is **the result of** part 1, :ref:`Writing in RST - Overview`.
    #. It serves as a basic guide to configuring Sphinx on a server.


.. contents:: Table of Contents


Overview
============

**Sphinx** is a platform that *renders RST files* to a web application
that is suitable for documentation. This guide provides a quick installation
guide for someone wanting to set up Sphinx on a VSP.

The `install sphinx guide <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html>`_
provides a good starting point, but we will make other changes to install
the latest version of Sphinx from PyPI.

The VPS setup for this workshop uses Docker image
`nginx:latest <https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx>`_, which uses Debian 10.


Installing Sphinx
=================

The `Sphinx documentation <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html>`_
provides instructions for Debian/Ubuntu (apt), RHEL/CentOS (yum),
and MacOS (homebrew). This guide will uses the ``apt`` package manager..

Unfortunately, the apt package manager for Debian has an old version of
Sphinx (Sphinx 1.8.4). It works, but PyPI has the `latest version of
Sphinx <https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/>`_. Therefore, this guide
shows to install Sphinx using both ``apt`` and ``pip3``.

.. note:: Other distributions are supported using pip, such as Alpine Linux.
    However, additional knowledge is required to install prerequisites for
    specific Python packages.

Spin up a VPS with your favorite Linux distro
---------------------------------------------

This workshop uses a simple ``docker-compose.yml`` file to start the
instance and then uses Nginx on the host as a reverse proxy. You can view
the :ref:`Sphinx Docker Environment`.

Install Sphinx using the package manager
----------------------------------------

You can choose to install the Sphinx version (1.7.x) using the apt package
manager or you install the latest version (2.x) using from PyPI using.

.. caution:: Installing both versions could result in a conflict.

#. Update your repository and upgrade any out-of-date packages using
   ``apt-get update && apt upgrade``.
#. Install a version of Sphinx:

   - Sphinx version 1.x

     a. Install Sphinx version 1: ``apt-get -y install python3-sphinx``

   - Sphinx version 2.x

     a. Install pip3: ``apt-get -y install python3-pip``
     b. Install Sphinx version 2: ``pip3 install Sphinx``


Configure Sphinx using ``sphinx-quickstart``
============================================

You need to configure Sphinx the first time you use it. Sphinx
provides a quickstart tool!

.. important:: Create and then change to the directory of your Sphinx
    code and RST content. The default installation directory is ``./``,
    which is the **current directory**.

#. Create a project folder, then navigate to that folder

    * For example: ``mkdir -p /opt/sphinx && cd /opt/sphinx``

#. Execute command ``sphinx-quickstart``
#. Follow the prompts (from version 1.x)

    We've highlighted the lines that we entered a value *other than*
    default. Add the extensions that you find useful.

    .. code-block:: bash
        :caption: Output of 'sphinx-quickstart' for v.1
        :linenos:
        :emphasize-lines: 9,10,34,39,46

        > Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]:

        Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
        for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
        files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
        > Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]:

        The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
        > Project name: Conference Demo
        > Author name(s): BilimEdtech
        > Project release []:

        If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
        you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
        translate text that it generates into that language.

        For a list of supported codes, see
        http://sphinx-doc.org/config.html#confval-language.
        > Project language [en]:

        The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
        or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
        > Source file suffix [.rst]:

        One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
        "contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
        of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
        document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
        > Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]:
        Indicate which of the following Sphinx extensions should be enabled:
        > autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/n) [n]:
        > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/n) [n]:
        > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/n) [n]:
        > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/n) [n]: y
        > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/n) [n]:
        > imgmath: include math, rendered as PNG or SVG images (y/n) [n]:
        > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/n) [n]:
        > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/n) [n]:
        > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/n) [n]: y
        > githubpages: create .nojekyll file to publish the document on GitHub pages (y/n) [n]:

        A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
        only have to run e.g. `make html` instead of invoking sphinx-build
        directly.
        > Create Makefile? (y/n) [y]:
        > Create Windows command file? (y/n) [y]: n

.. note::

    * The configurations for your Sphinx project are in file ``conf.py``.
    * Delete file ``conf.py`` to run the quickstart again.


Rendering to HTML
=================

We can configure Sphinx to *auto-build* the output when it detects a change,
or we can initiate a manual build.

The command to generate output is ``make <output>``. Sphinx can convert RST
to various formats. You can run the ``make command`` without any args to
view the possible output types.

.. code-block:: bash

    root@26f88a20b58c:/opt/sphinx# make
    Sphinx v2.3.1
    Please use `make target` where target is one of
    html        to make standalone HTML files
    dirhtml     to make HTML files named index.html in directories
    singlehtml  to make a single large HTML file
    pickle      to make pickle files
    json        to make JSON files
    htmlhelp    to make HTML files and an HTML help project
    qthelp      to make HTML files and a qthelp project
    devhelp     to make HTML files and a Devhelp project
    epub        to make an epub
    latex       to make LaTeX files, you can set PAPER=a4 or PAPER=letter
    latexpdf    to make LaTeX and PDF files (default pdflatex)
    latexpdfja  to make LaTeX files and run them through platex/dvipdfmx
    text        to make text files
    man         to make manual pages
    texinfo     to make Texinfo files
    info        to make Texinfo files and run them through makeinfo
    gettext     to make PO message catalogs
    changes     to make an overview of all changed/added/deprecated items
    xml         to make Docutils-native XML files
    pseudoxml   to make pseudoxml-XML files for display purposes
    linkcheck   to check all external links for integrity
    doctest     to run all doctests embedded in the documentation (if enabled)
    coverage    to run coverage check of the documentation (if enabled)

Our desired output is HTML.

#. Build the HTML by executing command ``make html``

   .. code-block:: bash

       root@1a40c1841674:/opt/sphinx# make html

Adding Content
==============

.. note:: All of the RST contents and settings are in the root of the
    Sphinx directory.

Default index.html
------------------

Executing ``make html`` on a default project creates an ``index.html``
in the root folder of the project using the parameters from ``conf.py``.

    .. code-block:: rst
        :caption: Default 'index.rst' file

        .. Demo documentation master file, created by
           sphinx-quickstart on Sun Dec 29 06:49:53 2019.
           You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
           contain the root `toctree` directive.

        Welcome to Demo's documentation!
        ================================

        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
           :caption: Contents:



        Indices and tables
        ==================

        * :ref:`genindex`
        * :ref:`modindex`
        * :ref:`search`


Create Folders
--------------

Sphinx makes it easy to organize content in folders.

#. Create a folder, such as ``web-guide``.
#. Create a file ``web-guide/index.rst`` with the following content:

   .. code-block:: rst
       :caption: web-guide/index.rst contents

       *******************
       Project X Web Guide
       *******************

       This guide provides the documentation for our web frontend.

#. Now, link to the ``web-guide/index.rst`` by placing the path in the
   root ``index.rst``.

   .. code-block:: rst
       :caption: ./index.rst contents
       :linenos:
       :emphasize-lines: 13

       .. Demo documentation master file, created by
          sphinx-quickstart on Sun Dec 29 06:49:53 2019.
          You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
          contain the root `toctree` directive.

       Welcome to Demo's documentation!
       ================================

       .. toctree::
          :maxdepth: 2
          :caption: Contents:

          web-guide/index


           . . .

#. Build the HTML and then refresh the page. The page should show up in
   the left navigation panel and on the home page.

   Pay close attention to the number of spaces, which should be exactly three.

   A wrong indentation level will result in an error similar to:

   .. code-block:: bash
       :linenos:
       :emphasize-lines: 7,8,11,12

       Running Sphinx v2.3.1

       copying extra files... done
       dumping search index in English (code: en)... done
       dumping object inventory... done
       build succeeded, 2 warnings.

       The HTML pages are in _build/html.



Install a Different Theme
=========================

Sphinx generates HTML, CSS, JS and support code using the
`Alabaster <https://github.com/bitprophet/alabaster>`_ theme by default.
Sphinx has ample `support for themes <https://sphinx-themes.org/>`_.
Write the Docs recommends these
`top four themes <https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/tools/sphinx-themes/>`_.

    - `Read the Docs Theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/>`_
    - `Alabaster <https://github.com/bitprophet/alabaster>`_
    - `Sphinx Bootstrap Theme <https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme>`_
    - `Guzzle Theme <https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle_sphinx_theme>`_


Install Read the Docs Theme
---------------------------
`Read the Docs Theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/>`_ is a
popular theme for Sphinx.
`PyPI hosts <https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-rtd-theme/>`_
Read the Docs theme.

#. Install ``pip3`` if you do not install it earlier:
   ``apt-get -y install python3-pip``

#. Install ``sphinx-rtd-theme`` using pip3:
   ``pip3 install sphinx-rtd-theme``
#. Edit your ``conf.py`` file and make the following modifications:

   .. code-block:: python
       :caption: conf.py

       import sphinx_rtd_theme

       extensions = [
           ...
           'sphinx_rtd_theme',
       ]

       # html_theme = 'alabaster'
       html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"

#. Rebuild the HTML to display the new theme. You can rebuild the HTML
   in the container from the host using ``docker exec``.

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Using docker-compose
        docker-compose exec sphinx bash -c "cd /opt/sphinx && make html"

        # Using docker
        docker exec -t sphinx_nginx bash -c "cd /opt/sphinx && make html"

   |rtd-theme|

.. hint:: Sometimes the HTML in folder ``_build`` contains old data,
    especially if you remove or rename a file.

    To solve this problem, you can safely delete the ``_build``
    and then use ``make html``` to generate a fresh copy.

    .. code-block:: bash
        :caption: From the host

        rm -r sphinx/_build/html
        docker-compose exec sphinx bash -c "cd /opt/sphinx && make html"
